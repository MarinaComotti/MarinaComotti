## Hi there üëã

### üçÑ About Me 
Hi, I'm Marina Comotti, a **Machine Learning Engineer** passionate about technology, innovation, and continuous learning. I am a Computer Science student at the Faculty of Computer Science, National University of La Plata (Facultad de Inform√°tica, Universidad Nacional de La Plata). 

### üíª My projects:
* **[Finance Specialist AI (Natural Language Processing):](https://github.com/MarinaComotti/Finance_Specialist_AI)**
Development of a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) for answering questions related to the financial sector through a fine-tuning process on Meta's open-source model Llama 3 üìä.
  - Technologies Used:  **Python, Hugging Face libraries (Transformers, Datasets, PEFT, Accelerate, Evaluate), Pytorch, Weights & Biases, NumPy, Matplotlib.**

* **[Malaria Project (Computer Vision):](https://github.com/MarinaComotti/Malaria_Project_Deep_Learning_CV)**
  Developed a binary classification model with 95% accuracy for detecting malaria in blood smear images, utilizing fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques. Additionally, a Streamlit application was created that allows users to use the model with new samples.
    - Technologies used: **Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Streamlit, Docker.**

* **[Ferreplus App (Web Application):](https://github.com/MarinaComotti/ferreplus-django-app)**
  Project created as an evaluation assignment for the Software Engineering II course at the Faculty of Computer Science (UNLP). This project covers all stages of the software development life cycle, applying the agile Scrum methodology.
    - Technologies used:  **Python, Django, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript.**
