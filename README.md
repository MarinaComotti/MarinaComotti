## Hi there üëã

### üçÑ About Me 
Hi, I'm Marina Comotti, a **Machine Learning Engineer** passionate about technology, innovation, and continuous learning. I am a Computer Science student at the Faculty of Computer Science, National University of La Plata (Facultad de Inform√°tica, Universidad Nacional de La Plata). 

### üíª My projects:
* **[Finance Q&A Chat (Natural Language Processing):](https://github.com/MarinaComotti/Finance_QA_Chat)** 
Fine-tuning of the Llama 3 model: Creation of a Large Language Model (LLM) specialized in answering finance-related questions through a fine-tuning process with QLoRa and quantization on the open-source Llama 3 model from Meta ü¶ô.
  - Technologies Used:  **Python, Hugging Face libraries (Transformers, Datasets, PEFT, Accelerate, Evaluate), Pytorch, Weights & Biases, NumPy, Matplotlib.**

* **[Malaria Project (Computer Vision):](https://github.com/MarinaComotti/Malaria_Project_Deep_Learning_CV)**
  Detection of Malaria in Images: Developed a binary classification model with approximately 95% accuracy for detecting malaria in blood smear images, utilizing fine-tuning and transfer learning of the NasNetMobile model. Additionally, created a Streamlit application that allows users to test the model with new samples.
    - Technologies used: **Python, TensorFlow, Keras,  Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.**

* **[Ferreplus App (Web Application):](https://github.com/MarinaComotti/ferreplus-django-app)**
  Project developed as an evaluation assignment for the Software Engineering II course at the Faculty of Computer Science (UNLP) using the agile Scrum methodology.
    - Technologies used:  **Python, Django, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript.**
